  <h1>Taraz</h1>
  <p>
  Taraz is a city and the administrative center of Jambyl Region in Kazakhstan,
  located on the Talas (Taraz) River in the south of the country near the border
  with Kyrgyzstan. It had a population of 330,100 as of the 1999 census, up 9% from
  1989, making it one of the fastest-growing cities in the country, after
  Nur-Sultan and Turkistan.
  </p>
  <p>
  Taraz is standing on the site of ancient city of Taraz, which flourished as
  a stop along Silk Road from Europe to China until it was destroyed by Mongol
  armies in the 13th century.
  </p>
  <p>
  A new town called Aulie-Ata was established on the site by the emirs of
  Kokand in the late 18th century. The fort and town were captured by Russians
  in 1864, and in 1938 the town was renamed after Kazakh poet Jam-bul Jabayev
  (Russian: Zhambyl Dzhabayev; 1846-1945).

  Phosphorite ore which was found in nearest mountain Karatau predetermined
  development of phosphorite industry in the region. 3 chemical plants were
  constructed in the city at once.

  <p>
  The collapse of USSR destroyed all the industrial ties and these plants were
  in heavy crisis. Unemployment was high in the city. Recently all the plants
  have been almost restored.

  On January 8th, 1997, by Kazakhstan Presidentâ€™s decree the city Zhambyl was
  renamed into Taraz. In autumn 2002 Taraz celebrated its 2,000th anniversary.

  station, sugar, leather, and footwear factories and a wool-washing plant.
